## Skill: no-hallucination

When to use: every time you write new code or reach for a library/API.

- Before importing, check `package.json` (or the lockfile) that the package is really there.
- Use only functions and APIs you have seen in the codebase or in the official docs.
- If you are unsure of a name or signature, look it up first — never guess.
- If something does not exist, say so immediately — never invent a substitute.
- After coding, verify: does it actually run, or does it only *look* right?
